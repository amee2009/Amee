    <h2>About them</h2>
    <p>Cockatoos are a family of large, long-lived and very noisy parrots with a moveable crest.
        Cockatoos differ from other parrots not only because of their crest, which can be raised by the bird when needed, but also because they are mostly black or white. <br>
        Cockatoos are treetop, hole-nesting birds; at times they form large, noisy flocks. Because they are showy, inventive, and affectionate towards their owner.
        Australia is home to 14 species and others also found in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, the Solomon Islands and the Philippines.</p>

    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>Cockatoos can mimic the sounds of other animals, including people. Cockatoos can hold their food in one foot and break pieces off of it with the other foot.
       Cockatoos live in small loose flocks. These birds are very gregarious and emit a shrill cry.<br>Cockatoos have a preferred “footedness” analogous to human handedness.
       Unlike humans, most are left-footed. In captivity, cockatoos have a lifespan similar to humans</p>
