    <h1>CANARY</h1>
    <h2>About them</h2>
    <p>The domestic canary, often simply known as the canary, is a domesticated form of the wild canary, a small songbird in the finch family originating from the Macaronesian Islands. 
        Canaries were first bred in captivity in the 17th century, having been brought to Europe by Spanish sailors.<br><br>Canaries readily breed with other species of finches. This hybridization yields unique canaries. 
        For example, red canaries resulted from the breeding of domestic canaries with red siskins, a South American finch.</p>

    <h2>Facts</h2>
